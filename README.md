The intuitive web interface allows for straightforward interaction with the application, providing a seamless user experience. Whether youâ€™re encoding secret plans or decoding mysterious messages, the application is designed for ease of use.

## Research/User Case
In a digital landscape where data privacy is paramount, this application provides a robust solution for users needing to encrypt sensitive information. Ideal for personal, professional, or educational use, it ensures that your messages remain confidential.

## Usage
1. Visit the [live application](https://loganprit.github.io/decoder-ring-capstone/) or clone the repository for local use.
2. If running locally, initiate the app with `node app.js` and open your browser to the indicated port.
3. Choose the desired encryption algorithm from the available options: Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or Substitution Cipher.
4. Enter your message, select 'Encode' or 'Decode', and watch as the application processes your input.
5. Your encoded or decoded message will display in the output area.

## Features
- **Multiple Encryption Algorithms**: Choose from Caesar Shift, Polybius Square, or Substitution Cipher for encoding and decoding messages.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A clean and straightforward interface allows users to easily select encryption methods and input their messages.
- **Real-time Encoding and Decoding**: Instantly see the results of your encrypted or decrypted messages.

## Technologies and Tools
- **JavaScript ES6**: Provides the functionality for our encryption algorithms and web interaction.
- **HTML5**: Structures the web interface, ensuring a responsive and accessible user experience.
- **Node.js**: Powers the backend, handling HTTP requests and serving the web interface.
